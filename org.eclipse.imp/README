This directory contains source patches for the following IMP revision:

  http://dev.eclipse.org/svnroot/technology/org.eclipse.imp@r22255

Note that building IMP from source code is not required for building Spoofax/IMP;
instead, the latest Spoofax/IMP binary plugin can be installed and used as a
baseline for rebuilding the remainder of the components.

We currently use the following plugins to build Spoofax/IMP:

- com.ibm.wala.shrike
- lpg.runtime.java (version 2.0.17 with an added qualifier; 2.0.17.qualifier)
- org.eclipse.imp.cheatsheets
- org.eclipse.imp.java.hosted
- org.eclipse.imp.lpg
- org.eclipse.imp.lpg.ide
- org.eclipse.imp.lpg.metatooling
- org.eclipse.imp.metatooling
- org.eclipse.imp.preferences
- org.eclipse.imp.prefspecs
- org.eclipse.imp.presentation
- org.eclipse.imp.runtime
- org.eclipse.imp.smapi
- org.eclipse.imp.smapifier
- org.eclipse.imp.xform
