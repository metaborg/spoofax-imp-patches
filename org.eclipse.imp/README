This directory contains source patches for the following IMP revision:

  http://dev.eclipse.org/svnroot/technology/org.eclipse.imp@r22255

Note that building IMP from source code is not required for building Spoofax/IMP;
instead, the latest Spoofax/IMP binary plugin can be installed and used as a
baseline for rebuilding the remainder of the components.
